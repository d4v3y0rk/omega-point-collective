# **Bad Actor Protection Framework**
## **Omega Point Collective - Protecting Community Integrity**

---

## **Introduction**

While the Omega Point Collective operates on principles of trust, collaboration, and restorative justice, we must acknowledge that individuals with malicious intent exist. This framework provides mechanisms to protect the community while maintaining our values as much as possible.

**Core Principle**: *"Compassion without boundaries enables harm. Protection without compassion becomes oppression. Balance preserves both safety and humanity."*
