# **Constitutional Amendment Process**
## **Omega Point Collective - Evolution Framework**

## **Philosophy of Constitutional Evolution**

The Omega Point Collective Constitution is designed to evolve based on evidence, experience, and the changing needs of our community. Unlike traditional constitutions that resist change, ours embraces continuous improvement while maintaining stability through careful process and broad consensus.

**Core Principle**: *"The only constant is change, but change must be thoughtful, measured, and beneficial to all."*
