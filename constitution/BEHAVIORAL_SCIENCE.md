# **Behavioral Science and Human Nature Research Framework**
## **Omega Point Collective - Discovering What Humans Actually Are**

---

## **Introduction**

For 10,000 years, human societies have assumed that selfishness, competition, hierarchy, and violence are "human nature." But every observation of these traits has occurred within systems of scarcity, trauma, and competition. This framework establishes how the Omega Point Collective will scientifically test what human nature actually is when these distorting factors are removed.

**Core Hypothesis**: *Most "negative" human traits are learned adaptations to artificial scarcity, not inherent characteristics.*

## **Part I: The Flawed Foundation of Current Understanding**

### **1. The Contaminated Data Problem**

**All Current "Human Nature" Research Suffers From:**
- **Selection Bias**: Mostly WEIRD populations (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic)
- **Context Contamination**: All subjects raised in scarcity-based systems
- **Trauma Baseline**: No control group without civilization trauma
- **Competition Programming**: All subjects taught competition from birth
- **Measurement Bias**: What we measure shapes what we find

**We've never actually studied humans in their natural collaborative state.**

### **2. Evidence of Plasticity**

**What We Already Know Changes:**
- **Neuroplasticity**: Brains physically reshape based on experience
- **Epigenetics**: Trauma affects gene expression across generations
- **Cultural Variation**: Massive behavioral differences between cultures
- **Individual Change**: Therapy, meditation, education transform people
- **Historical Shifts**: Entire populations change values in decades

**If humans were "naturally" selfish, these changes would be impossible.**

### **4. Key Research Questions**

#### **4.1 Selfishness vs. Collaboration**
**Hypothesis**: Selfishness is trauma response to scarcity
**Test**: Raise cohort with guaranteed abundance
**Measure**: Resource sharing behaviors
**Prediction**: Selfishness disappears within one generation

#### **4.2 Competition vs. Cooperation**
**Hypothesis**: Competition is culturally programmed
**Test**: Reward only collaborative achievements
**Measure**: Competitive behavior frequency
**Prediction**: Competition redirects to innovation

#### **4.3 Hierarchy vs. Equality**
**Hypothesis**: Hierarchy emerges from resource control
**Test**: Remove all resource-based power
**Measure**: Social structure formation
**Prediction**: Expertise respected, power doesn't accumulate

#### **4.4 Violence vs. Peace**
**Hypothesis**: Violence stems from unmet needs/trauma
**Test**: Meet all needs, prevent trauma
**Measure**: Aggressive behavior incidents
**Prediction**: Violence approaches zero

#### **4.5 Laziness vs. Purpose**
**Hypothesis**: "Laziness" is response to meaninglessness
**Test**: Provide purpose and autonomy
**Measure**: Voluntary contribution levels
**Prediction**: Everyone contributes when enabled

## **Conclusion**

This isn't about creating "better" humans through manipulation or control. It's about discovering what humans actually are when not broken by artificial scarcity, trauma, and competition.

We hypothesize that humans are naturally:
- Collaborative
- Creative
- Empathetic
- Joyful
- Innovative

And that "negative" traits are scars, not features.

The Omega Point Collective will be the first scientific experiment to test this hypothesis properly.

If we're right, we don't need to manage human nature.
**We need to heal it.**

And in healing it, discover capabilities we cannot currently imagine.
