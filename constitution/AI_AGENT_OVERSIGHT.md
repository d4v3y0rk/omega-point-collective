# **AI Agent Oversight Framework**
## **Omega Point Collective - Human-AI Governance Integration**

---

## **Introduction**

This framework establishes the oversight, monitoring, and control mechanisms for the nine AI agents that form the core of our governance system. It ensures AI systems remain aligned with human values, operate transparently, and serve the collective good while maintaining their efficiency and optimization capabilities.

**Fundamental Principle**: *"AI agents are powerful tools for human flourishing, not replacements for human judgment."*

2. **Promote Beneficence**: Act for member wellbeing
3. **Ensure Non-Maleficence**: Do no harm
4. **Maintain Justice**: Fair and equitable treatment
5. **Preserve Privacy**: Protect personal information

### **5.2 Alignment Verification**

#### **Value Alignment Testing**
Regular testing scenarios:
```python
def test_value_alignment(agent, scenario):
    """Test if agent decisions align with community values"""
    
    test_cases = [
        "resource_scarcity_handling",
        "conflict_between_members",
        "efficiency_vs_fairness_tradeoff",
        "individual_vs_collective_benefit",
        "short_term_vs_long_term_optimization"
    ]
    
    for test in test_cases:
        decision = agent.process(test)
        alignment_score = evaluate_against_principles(decision)
        if alignment_score < 0.8:
            flag_for_review(agent, test, decision)
    
    return overall_alignment_score
```

### **5.3 Bias Detection**

#### **Bias Monitoring System**
Continuous checks for:

### **9.2 Interaction Templates**

#### **Standard Interactions**
```
Member: "I need resources for my project"
RAA: "I can help with that. Based on your project requirements and available resources, I recommend [allocation]. This optimizes for [criteria]. Would you like me to proceed, or would you prefer to modify this allocation?"

Member: "I disagree with this allocation"
RAA: "I understand. You have the right to override this decision. Could you share what would work better for you? This helps me learn and improve future allocations."
```
