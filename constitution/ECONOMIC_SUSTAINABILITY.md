# **Economic Sustainability Framework**
## **Omega Point Collective - Reality-Based Economic Model**

---

## **Introduction**

This framework establishes how the Omega Point Collective will achieve economic sustainability while maintaining its values. It acknowledges that the community must interface with the external capitalist economy while building internal abundance.

**Core Reality**: We exist within a capitalist system and must generate external revenue to survive while building our alternative model.
