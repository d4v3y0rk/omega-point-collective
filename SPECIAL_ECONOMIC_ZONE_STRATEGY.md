# **Special Economic Zone Strategy**
## **Operating the Omega Point Collective Within Legal SEZ Frameworks**

---

## **Executive Summary**

By establishing the Omega Point Collective within Special Economic Zones (SEZs) or similar autonomous jurisdictions, we bypass most regulatory obstacles while maintaining full legal legitimacy. This approach has proven successful for Disney's Reedy Creek, Honduras's ZEDEs, Dubai International Financial Centre, and dozens of other projects worldwide.
